## Void Linux System

This repository includes my personal configurations, patches, and customizations for `dwm` and `st` on **Void Linux**. These customizations are designed to tailor the user experience to my specific needs while maintaining the spirit of simplicity and efficiency that both `dwm`, `st` and `dmenu` are known for.

**[`dwm`](https://st.suckless.org/)** (Dynamic Window Manager) is a minimalist and highly customizable tiling window manager for X11. **[`st`](https://dwm.suckless.org/)** (Simple Terminal) is a minimalistic terminal emulator also from the Suckless project. Both are known for their simplicity, speed, and extensibility.
